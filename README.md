counting-teeth
==============

Android app for calculating gear ratio's.

Gear ratio's are calculated using the 'Metres of development' method as described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_gearing#Methods.
There it requires the user to set the drive wheel's circumference in metres, the number of teeth of the front chain rings and the number of teeth in the rear sprockets.
The formula used is then:
	Metres of development = circumference x ( number of teeth in the front chainring / number of teeth in the rear sprocket )
